Place your full datasets here so the Svelte app can fetch them at runtime:

- Spotify.json  (from your original project `src/Spotify.json`)
- Reviews.json  (from your original project `src/Reviews.json`)

Optional assets:
- claybeabout.pdf (for the PDF link on the homepage)

During development, these are served at:
- /Spotify.json
- /Reviews.json
- /claybeabout.pdf

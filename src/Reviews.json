	"Review": "Decent film. I loved the friendship aspect of this film. The two boys having a mutual situation but different perspectives provided a unique coming of age film.<br/><br/>With that, this film certainly had a Miyazaki-feel to it. The story seemed to stumble into the next scene as the characters happened to be subject to their immediate situation much like you see in Castle In the Sky or Spirited Away. I found this film endearing but has higher expectations regarding the lengths at which the story would go geographically and literally.",

	"Review": "Subpar marvel movie, and that says a lot.<br/><br/>Black Widow as a character has so much mystery built up around her upbringing and it felt as though that was not addressed fully. The trauma we were told she experienced was different from what we saw. The story felt concocted as if Black Widow hit the scene as a character only in the last year.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the introduction of Yelena as a character into the MCU.<br/><br/>I hope that the Red Guardian returns as a villain in a Captain America film or featurette fighting off against either Steve Rogers or Isaiah Bradley (TFAWS).<br/><br/>Not my favorite MCU film and would have preferred as a short series as the MCU has gained a lot of traction and respect for their ability to pursue TV.",

	"Review": "Sean Penn murders this film. Exceptional performance on his part. The film kicked off with a gripping and disturbing scene which pulled me in. The plot began from their with a gradual growth of intensity followed by the eventual murder of Dave and detainment of Ray Jr.<br/><br/><br/>The stylistic choice of using fade in/out cuts throughout the film were calming and only added to the consistent somber feel.<br/><br/>The overall grim tone of the was recognized in the music, darker color and madness that overcame Dave and Jimmy.<br/><br/><br/>I enjoyed the subtle symmetry between Dave’s survival instinct submission during his capture to his survival instinct compliance when Jimmy convinces him he will let Dave go if he says he killed Katie. Dave only reacts to survive.<br/><br/><b>Criticism</b><br/><br/>I don’t understand why Eastwood chose to continue the film past the confrontation after the murder between Dave and Jimmy.<br/><br/>The whole Sean (Kevin Bacon) love story was weak. I wish that portion of the film had been extrapolated on or removed from the film altogether. Jimmy and Sean have an emotional scene at the end of the film and Sean ends it by answering a call with his wife who recently left him in a happy tone, ignoring the fact that he was just told by Jimmy (Sean Penn) that he killed Dave (Tim Robbins).",

	"Name": "The Suicide Squad", 
	"Year": "2021", 
	"Rating": "3.5", 
	"Review": "This is the redemption movie DC needed. After the flop that was the 2016 film of the same name, this Suicide Squad came thru with blunt comedy, just-the-right-amount of R-rated magic and the magnificent Peacemaker.<br/><br/>Off the bat, Peacemaker (John Cena) embodied the frat-boy-esc super hero you’d escape walking around in whitey tighties. His comedy was on point and the eventual plot twist he brought on near the end of the film was an enjoyable turn in the final third of the film.<br/><br/>James Gunn wasted no time diving straight into the film and expressing his love of music with Johnny Cash and his willingness to go R-rated with the initial killing off of half the Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>The scene at the bar about halfway thru the film was the only real time I felt the film diverted from what it embodied. The Suicide Squad is a group of villains imprisoned by the US government to fight or be killed by explosives in their spines. You wouldn’t expect them to enjoy a night out on the town drinking and laughing with one another with the irritation they have towards the situation and each other. This scene is especially odd when taking into account that the Squad just beforehand took out an entire town of freedom fighters by accident. This of course though is the way of James Gunn and he seemed to pull it off.<br/><br/>My rating is partly due to the redemptive nature of this film in light of its 2016 predecessor but also as a recognition to the way James Gunn was able to create a funny, emotionally-attaching, gory masterpiece out of a rag-tag group of super humans.",

The interviews were very planar; “yeah the park was crazy dangerous but we had fun”.<br/><br/>Equally confusing was the way the park’s creator, Gene, was villain-ized and then swiftly treated as an anti-disestablishment hero. The man’s ideas killed several people with no remorse.<br/><br/>The interviewees were off-pitch, strangely dramatic at times and unrewarding.<br/><br/>Quote: “when you talk to other people that went there, there’s a shared level of… sort of survivor’s respect.”",

Particularly when Danny is riding around his tricycle on the soft, silky carpet compared to the rough, punchy sound of the hardwood.<br/><br/>The music makes the film. Builds a tense, heart-pounding atmosphere with wonder and terror.<br/><br/>Most modern horror films aren’t as drawn out and patient as The Shining. In many ways, the patience and cadence of the film puts weight behind the tension that builds to a climax.<br/><br/>I don’t think I’ll watch this film often, but when I do, my attention will be kept.",

	"Review": "Basically Black Mirror.<br/><br/>I found the final act 10x as compelling as the rest of the film. The first two acts take a while to take shape and the film doesn’t feel as grounded. I didn’t feel attached to Alice (Florence Pugh) as Olivia Wilde would have intended. The film felt weak and purposeless for a significant portion of time. Upon a second watch, I could see how the constant cuts to abnormal imagery would make it more intriguing for the first two acts.<br/><br/><b>SPOILERS!</b><br/>That being said, this film is made in the final act. I did not expect the simulation twist and it quelled my fears of a unfulfilled ending. I thought Jack’s (Harry Styles) character arc and persona was made whole in the final 20min of the film.<br/><br/>All around, could’ve been an hour long Black Mirror episode and would’ve ranked in the mid/high tier of quality in the lineup. <br/><br/>I found the film puzzling, the characters distrusting and the truth of Victory Project disturbing.",

	"Review": "First off, Justin Long’s story arc - famous actor exposed by female costar for sexual assault - did not contribute to the film. The 5+ min it took to introduce him into the film felt unnecessary for an already short film. I get into AJ’s evil nature later on which makes sense in the context of his expressed situation.<br/><br/><br/>The only true surprise was Bill Skarsgard <b>wasn’t </b>the baddie, although I did assume he was cast to throw off the audience; I was partly right.<br/><br/>The cinematography was a bonus. Field of view increased as the character’s distress and fear increased. Shots were not jumpy either, average shot time <i>seemed </i>longer than normal (which is often a bonus in my book).<br/><br/>The use of light (and lack thereof) added fear and provoked curiosity in me. Red, pink and yellow lighting were used throughout strategically. <b>Yellow lighting </b>dominated the first night in the house with Tess (G Campbell) and Keith (B Skarsgard). I had the sense that this color represented safety with caution. We didn’t know who Keith was or what his intentions might be - untrustworthy! The flashlight and light in the basement light were yellow as well. The basement was a step closer to safety (in comparison to the dark, ominous hallway and below). The basement light was a beacon of hope when Tess and AJ escape from the caverns below. The flashlight represented the last sense of hope Tess or AJ had while navigating the caverns below. It literally led them to their escape and provided a path to safety. This hope was not without its own amount of caution though as darkness crept in from all non-lit areas.<b>Red lighting </b>is only used in scenes involving AJ (Justin Long). (1)When he is at a bar with his friend in Detroit telling the truth about “that encounter” with his (rightfully) convicting co-star and (2) When he and Tess are on top of the water tower escaping the Creature. In both scenes, AJ exposes his evilness. (1) brags about his “persistent” sexual nature and defends his innocence and (2) throws Tess off the tower in order to escape. <b>Pink lighting </b>was only used in the room where the Creature appeared to breast feed and seemingly sleep. Not even gonna try to guess what pink could represent.<br/><br/>As the monster arose from the darkness, fear slowly swelled in the character. I found this, as opposed to the jump scare, much more disturbing.<br/><br/>Was I scared, partly. Was I disturbed, I’ve been more disturbed from films of the same genre. This film did not hit my expectations. I had heard great reviews for this indie film from more than 5 people, including online rave reviews, and it underwhelmed any expectations I had.",

	"Review": "A story of regret, prejudice, desire and rejection which leaves the audience heartbroken and broadened. Slow paced and soft-toned in it's telling, Lee tackles a combination of place and agenda that few have engaged with. The audience walks away with a more nuanced perspective of the rancher archetype: A rugged individual whose desire, duty and conformity are all at odds. This ain't your John Wayne cowboy.<br/><br/>Regarding cinematography, Lee utilizes camera and production technics from last 19th century westerns throughout. The style leans towards fade cuts and far moving shots; reminiscent of rhinestone cowboy era films. I like to think this choice of technique was a nod to those older westerns; none of which took on the contentious subject of homosexuality. <i>The Power of the Dog (2021)</i>being the only other film of the same genre tackling this subject as far as I’m aware.<br/><br/>The conflict style is unique as it reflects<i>Man v. Man v. Society </i>while simultaneously <i>Man and Man v. Society</i>. Ennis and Jake are constantly split between conforming to social norms and confronting their desires. The familial tension leaves all parties confused and lost. The attitudes towards Ennis and Jake are brutal and aggressive.<br/><br/>This film is gentle and paced-well in it's telling while also being a brutal, heartbreaking tale.",

The audience comes for the music and choreography. Personal preference: I am not a fan of the pop-centric (sometimes electric and auto-tuned) musical styles in this soundtrack. It has <i>a few </i>gems in <i>a few</i>songs. I acknowledge the popularity with the younger crowd; just wasn’t for me.",

	"Review": "Black comedy is not a genre for everyone. I found the humor extremely dry, slow-paced and subtle... it was hilariously dreary.<br/><br/>The music is punchy, tense and aggressive. The string ensembles, throughout the film's soundtrack, build on anxiety and chaos to propel the film into a gradual downfall adventure.<br/><br/>This dystopian depiction cuts against the grain of the genre-average as it excludes any lords, flies and lords of flies. It has no terminators. No explosions or laser guns. David (Colin Farrell) attempts to live like a romantic vigilante; but in reality he's just a lump surrounded by a bunch of socially-inept lumps trying to escape the forced-companionship social impositions. It's a quaint story about loneliness and the most \"office space appropriate\" approach to breaking the law. <br/><br/>Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell are comedic gold. Both with their timing and bleakness. When Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) describes the secret sign language she and David created to say \"I love you\" (and much more).. I about fell off my seat. \"Would you like to play another game of 'touch-guess-think-win'\" after Rachel's character tells David she's blind.. I about croaked. The  \"Arrive to the city\" scene is just the best. The wild interest each of the characters have for common grocery store items fits so well into the paling world Yorgos Lanthimos manifests. And my lord these shots. The depth of focus and environment in each shot is incredible. The camera never settles to splash in unconventional angles to remind the audience of the cinematographer's ego :)<br/><br/>This wasn't just a comedy, romance or dystopian film. And it doesn't fit into the mainstream sense of any of those genres. The comedy is dry and bleak; less direct or slap stick. The romance is dry and bleak; less charming, predictable or pleasant. The dystopian aspects are subtle and work appropriate; less cataclysmic and action-packed. My wife put it best, \"It's not a story you can relate to.\"",

After the second watch I noticed the plot issues. The comedy and triumphs are cheap. Holds up for most times breaking the fourth wall for the sake of nostalgia and relatability. Cool to see Tobey and Andrew again. Won’t have a crazy crossover event at this scale ever again. Most of my stars go to that.",

I was consistently encouraged by each and every story point. The arc of Tim's courtship of Charlotte, the journey of Mary and Tim and the bittersweet death of a beloved patriarch. Each so wonderfully and genuinely done. The premise could easily have been executed in a cheap and dry manner; Yet the exact opposite is delivered. A delightful execution of one man’s unique, temporally revised destiny.<br/><br/>The cast was incredible. Gleeson and McAdams stand out in this stunning rom com. Very cool seeing Tom Hollander (<i>White Lotus Season 2</i>), Vanessa Kirby (<i>The Crown</i>) and Richard Griffiths (<i>Harry Potter</i>) play small yet memorable roles.<br/><br/>And the soundtrack! Felt right with the film.. stands above a cheesy rom com soundtrack with flare and impact.<br/><br/>Big on the quotes this time:<br/><br/><blockquote>“You have to use it for things you really think will make your life the way you want it to be.”</blockquote><blockquote>\"I am so... disinterested in a life without your father.\"</blockquote><blockquote>“No one can ever prepare you for what happens when you have a child... When you see the baby in your arms and you know that's your job now. No one can prepare you for the love and the fear. There are other things, of course - no one can prepare you for the bad nappies... No one can prepare you for the love people you love can feel for them... And nothing can prepare you for the indifference of friends who don't have babies...\"</blockquote>",

Padraic is stuck between Colm’s (Brendan Gleeson) rejection and Dominic’s (Barry Keoghan) pathetic antics. Colm, the more intellectual of the pair, is tired of wasting away in the pub aimlessly with Padraic. We’re left hoping for Padraic to find peace throughout but he fails to conquer the rejection. I empathize with both Colm and Padraic. We’ve all dealt with rejection as the giver or receiver and this tale brings to mind those occasions in my life. A simple premise beautifully executed.<br/><br/><blockquote>“I’ve changed, I just don’t have a place for dullness in me life anymore”</blockquote>",

	"Review": "Call me cliche, but I liked it. Poignant film for a parent-to-be. It makes parenting seem hopelessly exhausting. Attempts of comfort and compassion are met with apathy and agitation. Parenthood is presented as an afflicted journey marked by daily headaches and the fear of trying to do best by your children. It follows three men’s family journeys. Jason Robards, the apathetic, resentful savior. He’s least interested in his children but continues to save and invest in his youngest against better judgement. Rick Moranis, the ‘Einstein prodigy’ cultivator. He’s more focused on his child’s calculus practice than her own creativity. And Steve Martin, the dedicated, loving comforter who encourages his kids more than anything.<br/>Joaquin Phoenix steps up in this earlier film of his. Kid got chops. The whole comedic mass shooting scene (did I stutter?) did not age well and the sound mixing was what you’d expect of a low budget film.<br/>Can’t believe it was set in Kirkwood (filmed in Orlando). Makes me want some Spencer’s Grill. Really enjoyed, especially for an 80s family film.<br/><br/><blockquote>“You know, when I was nineteen, Grandpa took me on a roller coaster. Up, down, up, down. Oh, what a ride! I always wanted to go again. You know, it was just so interesting to me that a ride could make me so frightened, so scared, so sick, so excited, and so thrilled all together! Some didn't like it. They went on the merry-go-round. That just goes around. Nothing. I like the roller coaster. You get more out of it.”</blockquote>",

Very cool the way they integrated the original music and sounds of the Mario world. The platformer cinematics gave the game-to-film adaptation a unique feel.<br/><br/>The worst part of the film was Bowser’s love towards Peach. The wedding, the song, the everything. I thought it was horrid. “I’ll marry you just don’t hurt my toads” Lauren thought was funny. I learned from a guy at GameStop that the Mario world is pretty “lore-less”; In the games, Bowser’s mission was never to marry Peach, with the only exception being Super Mario Odyssey (2017).<br/><br/>It started strong but slowly lost its creative strength over time. The supporting characters who were built up early on became forgettable by the end. Story was pretty meh.",

Gorgeous sound.<br/><br/>Gary Valentine is a daaawwwg who is hatching plans all the time. Alana Kane eager to make something of her self with backwards driving skills that rival Toe Mater.<br/><br/>The side characters were great. Lance: a decorated child actor with a confidence that upstages Gary’s. Jack Holden (Sean Penn): an aged, but revered, actor speaking to others through the lines of his famed characters. Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper): the open-book film producer with an act for being sus.<br/><br/>The camera moves freely with a mind of its own, pivoting its focus with its own priorities. The comedy was subtle yet punchy. I like that PTA chose more vibrant colors than in his previous films; fits the 70s more. John Michael Higgins’ pseudo-Japanese is funny but in guilty way; feels like PTA is one of the few left that even attempts toeing that line.<br/><br/>A lot of my review goes towards the dialogue-heavy sequences between Gary and Alana. The final chase sequence where Alana and Gary run towards each other with subtle nods to previous moments in their relationship was beautifully done.",

Dove deep and stayed true to Nordic mythology in both form and telling.<br/><br/>The DP favored long shots, enhancing the raw nature of the story. “Nine shots contained over 2000 frames with the longest at 3m30s”. I’ll always favor long shots over quick jump cuts commonly found in american action sequences. Long shots help drive the emotion and realness of the action. Complimenting the shot selection was the natural lighting which dominated the film. The ripe green fields covered the day time while warm flames engulfed the colorless night.<br/><br/>Similar demonic, disturbing, gory atmosphere as Midsommar.<br/><br/><blockquote>“A life of death.

	"Review": "There is nothing like enjoying a hot dog and soda on the first baseline at Busch Stadium. The smell of peanuts, the crack of the bat and the ambience of the crowd bring peace to mind. This movie reminds us those memories we’ve all had. It is a spiritual journey honoring the history of America’s game. A simple tale executed beautifully; can’t get better than that. My only qualm is that it was shot like a made-for-TV movie.<br/><br/><blockquote>“This field, this game. It’s a part of our past Ray. It reminds us of all that once once good, and it could be again. Oh, people will come Ray. People will most definitely come.”</blockquote>",

	"Review": "Artistry at its peak. Boundary pushing. Different art forms coexist beautifully. It feels more like an art gallery than a superhero flick. Spot was by far my favorite character design; as the film progresses, Spot becomes more power-hungry and mad. In parallel with his arc, his visual portrayal becomes less realistic, more scattered and abstract.<br/><br/>The story is the collision of all things Spider-Man. Executes the multiverse concept way more effectively than its live action counterparts, like Spider-Man: No Way Home. Andy Samberg as Scarlet Spider and Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk brought the comedic vibes this film needed.",

	"Review": "\"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep\" :confused-face:<br/><br/><blockquote>Do you dare me… to climb that cactus?</blockquote>As always - the colors, set design and cinematography meld into a beautiful painting. The soundtrack is delightful, endearing and inquisitive. The three Steenbeck girls are an outstanding ensemble as with the other child actors; I could watch Woodrow Steenbeck in his own mini-series ten times over.<br/><br/>Most of Wes Anderson's films favor style over substance. Here, however, he makes a meta, wall-bending commentary on acting which (sort of) states: play on, even when the purpose is lost. This vibe is felt throughout. The story is meh in \"Asteroid City\" but multi-dimensional in the \"execution of the play of Asteroid City\".<br/><br/>Anderson held my attention (and my heart) most in one of the final sequences: In his search for purpose, Jones Hall (Augie / Jason Schwartzman) runs into Margot Robbie's character, who then narrates the most heart-wrenching scene from the play's script (although it was cut from the play); something about mamas talking from the dead just gets me.",
